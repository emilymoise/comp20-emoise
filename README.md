1. The purpose of this Git repository is to have a single place to store all of our work for Comp20. Because it is on Github, students have access to the files beyond the scope of the class and can continue to make improvements if they so desire.

2. My favorite assignment in the class was Assingnment 1: the portfolio. This was my favorite because we had the freedom to explore and discover things for ourselves. We were able to express our creativity on this project.

3. From day 1 to now, I have grown a lot with my understanding in web development. I am now aware of several tools and languages that I was not aware of before. 

4. I have a better understanding of how to read/interpret other people's code, which is a valuable skill to have. Examples include accessing Professor Ming's Github account to view examples from class and using segments of that code for assignments/labs. Another important thing that I have learned in this class is what happens when google.com is typed into the URL and enter is pressed. Examples: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=8902105. For me, this is particularly interesting to know and understand because I use the internet an extreme amount in my daily life so it is pretty cool to have an understanding of what is happening behind the scenes.

5. I would like to delve deeper into the topic of security. Since most of our lives revolve around the internet/media, security is of the upmost importance now more than ever. I would like to know more about vulnerabilities web programs face and how to make them more protected.
