The index.html page has been implemented correctly. The most recent messages appear first and all messages are stored in local storage. Refreshing the pages keeps the messages in local storage. It displays the local storage messages back on the screen in order. However, it only appears to do this correctly in Chrome and then it does not keep them in order in Safari. I discussed the assignment with Laurel Haeger and Sabrina Miller. I spent approximately 2 hours on this assignment.
